# Deployment Readiness Checklist

## Current Status: Pre-Deployment Review Required

**Date**: 2025-09-24  
**Phase**: Post-MVP, Pre-Production  
**Status**: ⚠️ NOT READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Data Persistence & Redis Memory Management ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Issue**: Redis is in-memory storage - data will be lost on restart
**Impact**: HIGH - All recommendation data disappears on service restart
**Priority**: P0 - Must fix before deployment

**Current State**:
- All data stored in Redis memory only
- No persistence configuration
- No backup/restore mechanism
- No data durability guarantees

**Required Actions**:
- [ ] Configure Redis persistence (RDB + AOF)
- [ ] Implement data backup strategy
- [ ] Add data recovery procedures
- [ ] Test persistence scenarios

### 2. Data Quality & Audit Trail ⚠️ HIGH
**Issue**: No tracking of data processing issues or skipped records
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Cannot verify data completeness or quality
**Priority**: P1 - Should fix before deployment

**Current State**:
- CSV parsing skips malformed lines silently
- No audit log of processing issues
- No data quality metrics
- Cannot identify which records were excluded

**Required Actions**:
- [ ] Implement comprehensive audit logging
- [ ] Track skipped/malformed records
- [ ] Add data quality validation
- [ ] Create data completeness reports

### 3. Code Review & Quality Assurance ⚠️ HIGH
**Issue**: No systematic code review or quality checks
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Potential bugs and maintainability issues
**Priority**: P1 - Should complete before deployment

**Current State**:
- No code review process
- No automated testing
- No linting/formatting checks
- No security review

**Required Actions**:
- [ ] Implement code review checklist
- [ ] Add automated testing suite
- [ ] Set up linting and formatting
- [ ] Security vulnerability assessment

### 4. Testing Strategy ⚠️ HIGH
**Issue**: No comprehensive testing framework
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Cannot guarantee system reliability
**Priority**: P1 - Should complete before deployment

**Current State**:
- Manual testing only
- No unit tests
- No integration tests
- No performance testing
- No error scenario testing

**Required Actions**:
- [ ] Unit test coverage
- [ ] Integration test suite
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Error handling validation
- [ ] Load testing

## Additional Pre-Deployment Requirements

### 5. Configuration Management
- [ ] Environment-specific configurations
- [ ] Secrets management
- [ ] Configuration validation

### 6. Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Application metrics
- [ ] Error tracking
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] Health check enhancements

### 7. Security
- [ ] Input validation
- [ ] Rate limiting
- [ ] Authentication/authorization
- [ ] Data encryption

### 8. Documentation
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Deployment guide
- [ ] Operations runbook
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Data Persistence** (P0)
   - Configure Redis persistence
   - Test data recovery scenarios

2. **Audit Logging** (P1)
   - Implement comprehensive logging
   - Track data processing issues

3. **Testing Framework** (P1)
   - Set up automated testing
   - Create test data sets

4. **Code Review** (P1)
   - Implement review process
   - Add quality checks

## Deployment Readiness Criteria

**MUST HAVE (P0)**:
- [ ] Redis data persistence configured
- [ ] Data backup/recovery tested
- [ ] Critical error handling

**SHOULD HAVE (P1)**:
- [ ] Comprehensive testing suite
- [ ] Audit logging system
- [ ] Code quality checks
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

**NICE TO HAVE (P2)**:
- [ ] Advanced monitoring
- [ ] Security hardening
- [ ] Documentation completion

## Risk Assessment

**High Risk**:
- Data loss on restart (Redis memory)
- Silent data processing failures
- No error recovery mechanisms

**Medium Risk**:
- Performance under load unknown
- Security vulnerabilities
- Maintenance complexity

**Low Risk**:
- Documentation gaps
- Monitoring limitations

## Timeline Estimate

- **Data Persistence**: 1-2 days
- **Audit Logging**: 1 day
- **Testing Framework**: 2-3 days
- **Code Review**: 1 day
- **Total**: 5-7 days before deployment ready

## Notes

- Current system is functional for development/demo purposes
- Production deployment requires addressing all P0 and P1 items
- Consider staging environment for testing fixes
- Document all changes and decisions
