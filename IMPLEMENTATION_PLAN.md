# Implementation Plan - Approach 1: Collaborative Filtering Recommender System

## Project Overview
Building a minimal working recommender system using collaborative filtering with FastAPI and Redis, designed to provide intelligent product recommendations based on order-item relationships from the `new_orders.csv` dataset.

## Architecture Components

### 1. **Data Layer** (`processing/`)
- **Purpose**: Process and analyze the CSV data to extract meaningful patterns
- **Key Components**:
  - `data_processor.py`: Loads CSV, builds co-occurrence matrix, calculates item statistics
  - **Output**: Item-item relationships, popularity rankings, order compositions

### 2. **Storage Layer** (`api/app/services/redis_service.py`)
- **Purpose**: Store and retrieve recommendation data efficiently
- **Key Components**:
  - Redis connection management
  - Item embeddings storage
  - Recommendation caching
  - Item statistics storage
- **Data Structures**: Hash maps for items, cached recommendations, statistics

### 3. **Business Logic Layer** (`api/app/services/recommendation_service.py`)
- **Purpose**: Implement collaborative filtering algorithms
- **Key Components**:
  - Item-based collaborative filtering
  - Basket-based recommendations
  - Popularity-based fallbacks
  - Similarity calculations

### 4. **API Layer** (`api/app/routers/`)
- **Purpose**: Expose recommendation functionality via REST API
- **Key Components**:
  - `health.py`: Service health monitoring
  - `recommendations.py`: Core recommendation endpoints
- **Endpoints**: Order recommendations, similar items, basket recommendations, popular items

### 5. **Configuration Layer** (`api/app/utils/config.py`)
- **Purpose**: Manage application settings and environment variables
- **Key Components**: Redis connection, API settings, recommendation parameters

## Current Status: Pre-Deployment Review Phase

**Completed Phases:**
- ‚úÖ Phase 1: Foundation (Project structure, dependencies, basic API)
- ‚úÖ Phase 2: Data Processing (CSV processing, co-occurrence matrix, audit logging)
- ‚úÖ Phase 3: Redis Integration (Data storage, caching, real-time recommendations)
- ‚úÖ Phase 4: Recommendation Algorithms (Collaborative filtering, similarity calculations)
- ‚úÖ Phase 5: API Integration (Working endpoints with real data)

**Current Phase: Pre-Deployment Review**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Issues Identified (See DEPLOYMENT_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md)
- üîÑ Implementing fixes for production readiness

**Key Metrics to Validate:**
- Total orders: ~154,951
- Total items: ~6,540
- Order size distribution
- Item frequency distribution
- Co-occurrence patterns

## Success Criteria

### Technical
- [ ] API responds in < 100ms for recommendations
- [ ] Redis operations complete successfully
- [ ] Data processing handles 497K+ records efficiently
- [ ] All endpoints return valid responses

### Functional
- [ ] Recommendations are relevant and diverse
- [ ] Similar items make logical sense
- [ ] Basket recommendations work for multiple items
- [ ] Popular items reflect actual data patterns

## Risk Mitigation

### Data Quality
- Handle missing or malformed data gracefully
- Validate item names and order IDs
- Implement fallback strategies for edge cases

### Performance
- Use Redis caching for frequent requests
- Optimize data processing for large datasets
- Implement connection pooling for Redis

### Scalability
- Design stateless API components
- Use efficient data structures
- Plan for horizontal scaling
